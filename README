**This library is outdated, don't use it! You can just set up your column as :decimal and active record will handle all the serialization into and from BigDecimal for you, and it's supported by rails itself**

Scrooge
=======

Make it easy to store money values in an ActiveRecord model, avoiding the
annoying floating point math. The idea is to store the monetary values as
the amount of cents in the database to avoid the math.

    class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
      attr_cents :price
    end

    product = Product.new(:price => 10.99)
    product.price #=> #<Scrooge::Money @cents="1099">

The Scrooge::Money objects will act as a Numeric in all regards, so you can
do math with other numbers easily.

The `products` table should have an integer column `price_in_cents` for
this to work.

Calculations
------------

If you need aggregated calculations on your model, you can use the provided
method Numeric#as_cents, which converts a number to a Scrooge::Money instance,
assuming that the number is already the number of cents. For example:

    class Sale < ActiveRecord::Base
      belongs_to :product
      attr_cents :value
    end

    class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :sales

      def gross_sales
        sales.sum(:value_in_cents).as_cents
      end
    end

    product = Product.create
    product.sales.create(:value => 20)
    product.sales.create(:value => 20.5)
    product.sales.create(:value => 25)

    product.gross_sales #=> #<Scrooge::Money @cents="6550">
    product.gross_sales == 65.5 #=> true

Why?
====

Because we only needed this, and most of the gems that do this stuff are too
damn big and have a ton of un-needed functionality.

Install
=======

    gem install scrooge

Then, in order to require it, if you want the ActiveRecord helper methods:

    require "scrooge/active_record"

Or:

    config.gem "scrooge"
